= IcyRocks-Java
IcyRocks-Java is a java implemented game workload based on analysis of real computation patterns.
IcyRocks is developed based on cocos2d for android and JBox2d. Cocos2d for android is a java port of cocos2d on Android. JBox2d is a java port of Box2D physics engine.

== Source Files
The Source Files are all under /src
* files under /src/com/intel/ are developed by Intel.
* files under /src/org/ are from open source project cocos2d at https://github.com/ZhouWeikuan/cocos2d
* files under /src/aurelienribon are from open source project box2d-editor at https://code.google.com/p/box2d-editor

== Matrics
* The main metrics of this workload is AFPS on bottom-left. It means average FPS since last scenario change.
* There are also other four metrics:
  FPS: instant FPS, calculated every 100ms
  TIME: total execution time since last scenario changed
  SNOW: number of snow grains in scenario. More snow grains means higher computation load.
  ROCK: number of icy rocks in scenario. More rocks means higher computation load.

== Requirements

In order to use IcyRocks-Java, you will need to have an android device with android verison equal or
later than 4.4, which means SDK API level later or equal to 19.
The previous version of android was not guaranteed to sucessfully run this workload.

== Build
You can build IcyRocks-Java in command line or in Eclipse.

===Build in command line:
You can build this workload under Android Project Source tree.
Android version should be larger or equal to 4.4 (SDK API level >= 19)
We have made an Android.mk under the project root folder.
following steps to build AndroidGCBench.apk
* From the [ANDROID_ROOT] run:
  build/envsetup.sh
  lunch <target>
* Now goto art/workloads/icyrocks-java/GameWorkload run:
  mm or mmm

By default, this will build the IcyRocks-Java.apk and save it into:
[ANDROID_ROOT]/art/workloads/icyrocks-java/GameWorkload/bin/IcyRocks-Java/

===Build in Eclipse:
* Android SDK version should be later or euqal to 19.
* Start eclipse and click File -> import menu, the import dialog will pop up.
* Choose General -> Existing Projects into Workspace, and click next
* Set the root directory to the path to .project file, GameWorkload will show up, select it and click finish.
* Now IcyRocks project is imported into eclipse, and eclipse will build this project automatically.

== Usage
* Install GameWorkload.apk on your device
* Launch the GameWorkload application
* Tap the screen to change rock and snow grain numbers. Current default setting will add 10 rocks for each tap.
* You can change configuration of scenario by using command line parameter:
  "adb shell am start -n com.intel.gameworkload/.MainActivity -e nsnows 10 -e nrocks 20 -e rockstep 10 -e snowstep 15 -e transition 2 -e execTime 5000"
  ** nsnows: number of snow grains. Default is 20.
  ** nrocks: number of rock. Default is 10.
  ** rockstep: number of added rocks for each touch. Default is 10.
  ** snowstep: number of added snow grains for each touch. Default is 0.
  ** transition: the time ignored at beginning of application and rock/snow number changes. It's specified in seconds. Default time is 2.
  ** execTime: the execution time of activity in ms. (5000 means 5 seconds). Default is 0, means never exit automatically.
